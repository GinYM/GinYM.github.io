Hi, I am *@eamon* (Yiming, Jin), a student in SJTU and incoming graduate student in UCSD major in CS. I work as an intern in Baidu using Hadoop to handle large-scale logs. 

My previous research is BCI(Brain computer interface), I have published two papers related to BCI. But now I am more interested in backend. It seems that it still have a lot to learn....
